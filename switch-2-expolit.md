# Its only been a day...

And the switch 2 is already been opened. lol, lmao even.

Its not a full exploit or remote code execution or anything, its a "Userland ROP". (I have no Idea about the technichal details)

I DO find it humourous, just how little time it took, Especially with Nintendo braging about their _UNBREAKABLE SECURITY_.

Its only a matter of time. There is no such thing as a system without exploits, its not gonna take much time before we gain unauthorized code exucution rights, maybe even a firmware over-ride, to run homebrew and _other stuff_.
